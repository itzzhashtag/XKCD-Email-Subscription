# XKCD Email Subscription System (Assignment Submission)

## 📋 Overview
This assignment is for the **XKCD Email Subscription System** using **PHP**.

All required features have been implemented **inside the `src/` directory** as per the instructions.

---

## ✨ Implemented Features

### 1️⃣ Email Verification & Subscription
- Users can **register using their email** and receive a **6-digit numeric verification code**.
- Verified emails are stored in `registered_emails.txt`.

### 2️⃣ Unsubscribe Mechanism
- All outgoing emails include a working **Unsubscribe link**.
- Users can **unsubscribe by verifying a 6-digit code**, which removes their email from the system.

### 3️⃣ XKCD Comic Delivery (CRON Job)
- A **CRON job automatically runs every 24 hours** to:
  - Fetch a random XKCD comic using the XKCD API.
  - Send the comic as **formatted HTML emails** to all subscribed users.
  - Each email contains an **unsubscribe link**.

---

## 🛠 Technical Notes

- Emails tested using **Mailpit** at `http://localhost:8025/`.
- Emails are **HTML-formatted** (no JSON or plain text).
- **No database used**—email storage handled through a **simple text file** (`registered_emails.txt`).
- All required functions implemented inside `functions.php`.
- **CRON job setup included**:
  - `setup_cron.sh` to configure CRON.
  - `cron.php` to handle daily email sending.
